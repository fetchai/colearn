# Welcome to the Fetch.ai Collective Learning

Colearn is a library that enables privacy preserving decentralized machine learning tasks on the FET network.

This blockchain-mediated collective learning system enables multiple stakeholders to build a shared machine learning model without needing to rely on a central authority. This library is currently in development. 

### Current Version

We have released *v.0.1* of Colearn Machine Learning Interface, the first version of an interface that will allow developers to prepare for future releases. 
Together with the interface we provide a simple backend for local experiments. This is the first backend with upcoming blockchain ledger based backends to follow.  
Future releases will use similar interfaces so that learners built with the current system will work on a different backend.
The current framework will then be used mainly for model development and debugging.
We invite all users to experiment with the framework, develop their own models, and provide feedback!

## Installation
Setup an environment

`pipenv --python 3.6 && pipenv shell`

```bash
pip install -e ./
```
Running the tests:
```
tox
```

## Quick Overview
The collective learning protocol allows learners to collaborate on training a model without requiring trust between the participants. Learners vote on updates to the model, and only updates which pass the quality threshold are accepted. This makes the system robust to attempts to interfere with the model by providing bad updates. For more details on the collective learning system see [here](docs/about.md)

## Running the demo
```bash
bin/run_no_networking_demo.py -t MNIST
``` 
For other demo options see [here](docs/demo.md)

## Writing you own models
We encourage users to try out the system by writing their own models. Models need to implement the collective learning interface, which provides functions for training and voting on updates. More instructions can be found [here](docs/customisation.md)
